Project Description
The Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application is a classic two-player game where the objective is to place three of your markers (X or O) in a row on a 3x3 grid. The game is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the interactive game logic. Players take turns clicking on the grid cells to place their markers. The application checks for a winner after each move and announces the result, whether it's a win, a draw, or the continuation of the game.

Rules
Game Setup:

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of squares.
One player is assigned "X" and the other "O".
Gameplay:

Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their marker.
A cell cannot be selected more than once in a single game.
The game checks for a win after each move. A win occurs when a player has three markers in a row, column, or diagonal.
Winning and Drawing:

The game ends when one player has three markers in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game is declared a draw.
Restarting the Game:

After the game ends (win or draw), players can restart the game by clicking a "Restart" button, which resets the board.
Conclusion
The Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application is a fun and interactive game that can be enjoyed by users of all ages. This project is an excellent way to practice front-end development skills, particularly in handling user interactions, managing game state, and implementing logic to check for winning conditions. The game provides immediate feedback to users, making it an engaging way to learn and apply web development concepts.

Uses
Entertainment: A simple and classic game that provides quick entertainment for users.
Learning Tool: It serves as an educational example for those learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating how to create interactive web applications.
AI Development: This game can be expanded to include an AI opponent, providing a more challenging gameplay experience and a deeper understanding of algorithms and game theory.
Teaching Logic and Strategy: Tic-Tac-Toe can be used to teach basic concepts of logic, strategy, and decision-making, making it suitable for educational purposes in classrooms or workshops.
Web Development Portfolio: A completed Tic-Tac-Toe project can be added to a web developer's portfolio to showcase their skills in building interactive applications.
